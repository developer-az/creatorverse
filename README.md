## Notes

### Challenges Encountered:
- **Supabase Setup**: Initially had issues with database table configuration, particularly with UUID primary key auto-generation
- **Styling Conflicts**: Had to resolve conflicts between index.css and App.css for proper theming
- **Git Security**: Encountered GitGuardian security warnings for API keys, resolved by implementing environment variables
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the glassmorphism effects worked properly across different screen sizes

### Technical Decisions:
- **Supabase over Firebase**: Chose Supabase for its PostgreSQL foundation and excellent developer experience
- **Vite over Create React App**: Used Vite for faster development and better build performance
- **CSS over component libraries**: Built custom CSS for unique glassmorphism design rather than using pre-built components
- **Environment variables**: Implemented proper security practices even though anon keys are safe to expose

### Additional Context:
This project showcases modern web development practices including:
- **Full-stack development** with React frontend and Supabase backend
- **Modern UI/UX design** following current design trends
- **Security best practices** with environment variable configuration
- **Accessibility considerations** with proper contrast and semantic markup
- **Performance optimization** with efficient database queries and image handling

The app demonstrates proficiency in React development, database management, modern CSS techniques, and overall full-stack web application architecture.
